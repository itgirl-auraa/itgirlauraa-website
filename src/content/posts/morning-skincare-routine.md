Starting your day with a proper skincare routine is essential for maintaining healthy, glowing skin. Here's my tried-and-true morning routine that takes just 10 minutes but makes a world of difference.

## 1. Gentle Cleansing

I start with a gentle, non-stripping cleanser. Look for ingredients like:
- Ceramides
- Glycerin
- Hyaluronic acid

These help maintain your skin barrier while removing overnight buildup.

## 2. Vitamin C Serum

A potent antioxidant serum is your best defense against environmental damage. I apply 3-4 drops of a vitamin C serum while my skin is still slightly damp from cleansing.

## 3. Hydrating Toner

Instead of harsh astringents, I opt for a hydrating toner with:
- Rose water
- Centella asiatica
- Beta-glucan

Pat it gently into your skin rather than wiping.

## 4. Lightweight Moisturizer

Even if you have oily skin, don't skip moisturizer! Choose a lightweight, non-comedogenic formula that works for your skin type.

## 5. Sunscreen (Never Skip!)

The most crucial step: broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher. This protects against:
- UV damage
- Premature aging
- Hyperpigmentation

Remember: consistency is key! Stick to this routine for at least 4-6 weeks to see results.
